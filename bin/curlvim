curlvim - v0.5 - 3/7/2011

echo "Usage: `basename "$0"` [curl_options...] url"

Curl a remote file into vim, setting the filename based on the URL's filename.
If a file extension can't be determined from the URL, .html will be used by
default. If you're just specifying a domain without scheme (eg. benalman.com),
use a trailing / to keep curlvim from using the TLD as the file extension.

The vim executable will be auto-magically determined by stripping any leading
"curl" off this script's filename. For example, call this script "curlgvim"
and gvim will be run. If this naming convention isn't used, the executable
will default to "vim".
